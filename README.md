# Project for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data
The script run_analysis.R works on the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The script merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set, creates a second, independent tidy data set (means.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

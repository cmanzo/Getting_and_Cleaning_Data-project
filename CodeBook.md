##Code Book
The file means.txt contains 81 features means values collected for
30 subject (individuals) performing 6 different activities ("LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS")

The means were obtained from the data in:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

by:

merging training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Creating a second, independent tidy data set (means.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity (6: "LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS") and each subject (30 individuals).
